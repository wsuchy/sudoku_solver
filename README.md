## Sudoku solver written in Haskell

This is my first program written in haskell. It was made only for learning.

## Currently implemented algorithms:
- Basic sudoku rules
- Find places where only one digit can be put
- Guessing

## Todo
- Implement other algorithms like eliminating false possibilities
- Explode this file into modules
- Make code more readable
